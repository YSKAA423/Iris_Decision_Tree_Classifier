    "## As part of the [Spark Foundation internship](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-sparks-foundation/), this project involves creating a Decision Tree classifier and visualizing it graphically. The classifier should be able to predict the right class of iris flowers when fed new data, showcasing the ability to handle intermediate-level machine learning tasks.\n",
